                <p>Hello there, I'm Nisha, and I have been learning web developement lately (a little of web design as well). I started writing this web page right after finishing up <a href="https://frontendmasters.com/courses/css-grid-flexbox-v2/starting-css-setup/">this</a>  amazing layout design course by <em>Jen Kramer</em> on frontend masters, just to practice and implement it all before it turns into floating bits of information here and there. So I threw all of my random snapchat images in, and it turned out I didn't like the regualr Lorem ipsum next to my images, so I started writing randomly about the images or anything that came to my mind that time, and now it looks like an About-Me magazine! Well the purpose is not lost, I learned better, put more efforts in all the excitement. So here's your regular flexbox and grid layout .</p>

                 <p>This is not a daily journal per se, but it's more of a record type. I kept the title because it went well with the layout. </p>
                <h4>Imagine [the Journal]</h4>
                <p>
                    Well this is a little something from one of my recent <em>journal-type</em> blogs that never got to be published (or let's say, are yet to be published).<br><br>
                    <q><em>Yet another day of learning how to not get lost in the never ending task list. Yesterday, as I can see was not as long as assumed, in fact it doesn't seem like a legit day at all looking back now, in fact it was one of those days which do not have a sense of time at all.
                        Like you've got all the time to plan the things and write the to-do list for the day,
                        but as soon as you start working, it's over! Yeah, you start  the timer,
                        focus your attention on the screen in front of you, switch between a few ( a hundred) tabs, write some code, scroll through some articles, take some notes, stare at the screen, keep staring but
                        suddenly the light starts to feel too much on your eyes, you look around to take a break and bam! it's dark already, the day's gone with no respect for time at all.
                        You see,? I don't understand what all this rush is about!
                        <br><br>
                        But that's how it goes most of the times, setting up the to-do list and,... that's it, you don't even get to look at it again that day. It's been like this for a long time, but what I have just learned is, that when you are learning, (which is always the case) you can't always control how many items you cross on that always staring-back-at-you to-do list, but you can always control how much time, energy and focus, you can put in, well at least that's what I am relying on, these days.

                 <p style="font-family: 'Comforter Brush', cursive;">Yes. I am a big fan of journals.</p>
                <h4>What is an Art Journal?</h4>
                 <p>According to wikipedia,- <br>
                     An art diary, art journal or visual journal is a daily journal kept by artists, often containing both words and sketches, and occasionally including mixed media elements such as collages. Such books will frequently contain rough workings, in cartoon form, of ideas later to appear in finished works, as well as acting as a normal diary, by allowing the artist to record their day-to-day activities and emotions.

                    These diaries not only give art historians a valuable opportunity to explore the creation process of these finished works, but they are a useful biographical tool.
                    
                    Many famous artists are known for their art diaries – the sketchbooks of Leonardo da Vinci are probably the best known example. Other artists to have used art journals include Frida Kahlo.</p>
                <p>That's a little too much, but I had to copy pasted to fill up the space. Anyway, according to me an art journal is anything like a regular journal with more visuals than words in it, as long as you use it express yourself at that moment or occassion or journey or event, you use papers scraps, colors flowers, like <em>Anything</em>. Also, you definitely don't have to be an artist to have an Art Journal.</p>
